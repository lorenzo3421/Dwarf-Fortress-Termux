# Dwarf Fortress on Termux

A bash script that installs the ASCII Dwarf Fortress on Android devices using Termux!

## Installation

Commands are separated as I was not able to make them run together, for some reason the -y flag doesn't actually say yes to everything in pkg update.
```bash
pkg update && pkg install wget
```
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzo3421/Dwarf-Fortress-Termux/main/df-termux.sh | bash
```
